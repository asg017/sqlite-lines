# sqlite-lines-linux-x64

A `sqlite-lines` platform-specific package for `linux-x64`. 

When `sqlite-lines` is installed and the host computer has a `linux` operating system with `x64` architecture, then this package is downloaded with the pre-compiled SQLite extension bundled under `lib/lines0.so`. At runtime, the `sqlite-lines` package will resolve to this platform-specific package for use with [`better-sqlite3`](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3)' or [`node-sqlite3`](https://github.com/TryGhost/node-sqlite3).

See the `sqlite-lines` package for more details.
